          <br />
          The Awesome Box is a project initially implemented at Harvard University as a library engagement project. When people return their library books, they have the option to mark them as 'awesome', or recommend them to other users. Books are scanned and uploaded to the website for all to see. I have designed and implemented the front-end of the site.
